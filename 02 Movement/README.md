I  continued with the idea I had in 01, now implementing actual movement; expressed through the randomness and repetition of the shapes and words— the circle keeps travelling across the screen while the words shift unpredictably, showing how motion can feel uneven or spontaneous at times. 

Random words like 'shift' and 'rush' appear like thoughts during motion, emphasising its energy and instability with each frame feeling alive and moving, even if nothing travels smoothly.

Again, a black background was used to maximise the contrast as much as possible and force the viewer to look at the jittering of words and shapes.
