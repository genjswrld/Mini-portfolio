 There were multiple emotions I had initially wanted to convey, and I found that they all of these had an underlying theme that related to stimulation; an overstimulation of sorts. 

Upon choosing overstimulation as the emotion I wanted to convey, I decided to have a chaotic background with a singular foreground entity to represent a 'person' or the mind, in this case; the colour was jet black to provide not only a sense of detachment but to feel relatable to someone of any race, age, or ability. 

The background and shapes in he background change to a new bright neon colour every time the mouse is clicked, representing the constant sensory change. The shapes' positions and sizes being randomised per click also aimed to create a visual noise that reflected the concept of being overstimulated.
